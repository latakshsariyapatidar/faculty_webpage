          "description": "Grid-forming inverters (GFMs) are an emerging class of power-electronic converters designed to operate like traditional synchronous generators by establishing voltage, frequency, and phase references in the grid. Unlike conventional grid-following inverters, which depend on an existing grid to synchronize, GFMs can energize islands, support black-start operations, and provide synthetic inertia and damping. This makes them essential for future power systems with high renewable penetration, where conventional rotating machines are being displaced. My research focuses on improving the stability of GFM-dominated systems, developing robust control strategies (droop control, virtual synchronous machine control, and adaptive inertia emulation), managing short-circuit behavior and fault current limitation, compliance to grid codes like IEEE 2800-2022, and coordinating GFMs with conventional generators and grid-following inverters. We are also exploring protection challenges, interaction issues in multi-inverter systems, and the integration of GFMs in weak and islanded grids to ensure reliable, resilient, and secure power system operation.",

          "description": "Cybersecurity in smart grids has become a critical research area as increased digitalization, widespread deployment of communication-assisted controls, and integration of distributed energy resources expose power systems to sophisticated cyber threats. Present challenges include the vulnerability of measurement data, control signals, and communication networks to False Data Injection (FDI) attacks, Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, and coordinated cyber-physical intrusions that can compromise situational awareness and system stability. Current research focuses on developing high-fidelity cyber-physical models to capture attacker capabilities, system responses, and cascading impacts. Advanced data-driven and hybrid detection methods—such as machine learning, anomaly detection, state estimation residual analysis, and physics-informed AI—are being explored to identify stealthy FDI attacks. For DoS threats, researchers are investigating resilient communication protocols, adaptive control strategies, and distributed architectures that maintain system performance under delayed or lost data. Mitigation techniques include observer-based controllers, secure state estimators, encryption schemes optimized for low-latency grid operations, and robust control designs that ensure stability even under partially compromised measurements. My research aims to build self-healing, attack-resilient smart grids capable of maintaining reliability despite evolving cyber threats.",

          "description": "Green hydrogen, produced using renewable electricity through electrolysis, plays a pivotal role in enabling deeper grid integration of intermittent resources such as solar and wind. It requires DC voltage accross the electrolyzer which is obtained using rectification of the AC voltage or directly from PV sources which generates DC. By acting as a flexible and scalable energy storage medium, green hydrogen can absorb excess renewable generation during periods of high supply and low demand, thereby mitigating curtailment and smoothing variability. It can be reconverted to electricity through fuel cells or gas turbines. It can provide essential grid support services including firm capacity, frequency regulation, and long-duration storage. My current research interests include designing control strategies for the converters for grid support, controlling DC-DC converter for smooth operation of the electrolyzer and stability analysis of green hydrogen in presence of renewables and grid for varying operating conditions.
